This project took some learning for sure. 

I learned that google likes to use Bezier curves for their objects. I played and made the 3x3 icon for fun but I was not going to mess with that magnifying glass. 


There's some naming that could be improved and some simple code cleanup for sure. There's also a few style things that don't do anything fancy on hovering or clicking.
All in all though I'm putting my finishing stamp on this. I'm moving on to more learning so I'm not stuck on one webpage.
